# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Project Overview
Creating analysis of a production process that is experiencing issues and blocking productivity. The dataset contains information for a company titled AutosRUs and its newest prototype, the MechaCar. The analysis will utilize the R studio tool and several statistical tests, such as t-tests.  The following are the requests that were performed to complete the analysis:
- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical  analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
