# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Project Overview
Creating analysis of a production process that is experiencing issues and blocking productivity. The dataset contains information for a company titled AutosRUs and its newest prototype, the MechaCar. The analysis will utilize the R studio tool and several statistical tests, such as t-tests.  The following are the requests that were performed to complete the analysis:
- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical  analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Results

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The variables that provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg value are vehicle length and ground clearance of the vehicle(as well as the intercept).  These two variables have a significant amount of impact on miles per gallon(mpg).  The variables may need adjusting to affect the change in mpg of a vehicle.  

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the multiple linear model is not zero because there are variables that have a linear relationship with the dependent variable.  


- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
This linear model can predict mpg somewhat. It has a linear relationship with only two variables so it would seem there are more variables that should be considered.  

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
