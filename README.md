# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Project Overview
Creating analysis of a production process that is experiencing issues and blocking productivity. The dataset contains information for a company titled AutosRUs and its newest prototype, the MechaCar. The analysis will utilize the R studio tool and several statistical tests, such as t-tests.  The following are the requests that were performed to complete the analysis:
- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical  analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Results

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The variables that provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg value are vehicle length and ground clearance of the vehicle(as well as the intercept).  These two variables have a significant amount of impact on miles per gallon(mpg).  The variables may need adjusting to affect the change in mpg of a vehicle.  

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the multiple linear model is not zero because there are variables that have a linear relationship with the dependent variable.  


- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
This linear model can predict mpg somewhat. It has a linear relationship with only two variables so it would seem there are more variables that should be considered.
